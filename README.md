I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed my first task as part of my CodeAlpha internship!



ðŸ§® Project: Titanic Survival Prediction

ðŸ“Š Technologies Used: Python, Machine learning 



In this project, I have collected, cleaned, and preprocessed the data utilizing various Python libraries. Further, I have analyzed the dataset and trained the model using this data, and subsequently predicted the outcomes using logistic regression.
